## Description

This project was created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. It uses **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** to present a simple Restaurant Reviews application, displaying a series of restaurants in the local area, a map of their location, details on the restaurant, such as address and opening hours, as well as a selection of user reviews.

## Instructions

In this project, a static webpage that lacks responsiveness and accessibility is to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be converted to a Progressive Web Application by caching assets for offline use.

To run the application:

1. Go to [here](https://github.com/astott9/fend-restaurant-reviews-app/)

2. Download as .zip file or clone the project.

3. Inside the new directory, start a local client server on port 8000.

4. With your server running, go to: `http://localhost:8000`.
